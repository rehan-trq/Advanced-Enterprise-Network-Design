# Advanced Enterprise Network Design with Integrated Security and Dynamic Routing

## Overview
This project demonstrates a robust enterprise network design implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer. It integrates dynamic routing, Network Address Translation (NAT), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), and Access Control Lists (ACLs) to enable secure and efficient communication across multiple departmental networks. The topology is segmented into three distinct clusters: Finance, IT, and Admin.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Routing (EIGRP):**  
  Utilizes EIGRP for fast convergence and efficient routing between networks.
- **Network Address Translation (NAT):**  
  Implements dynamic NAT on Router-1 to translate private IP addresses from the Finance and Admin networks when communicating with external networks.
- **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP):**  
  Automates IP address assignment for devices in the Finance and Admin networks.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs):**  
  Secures network traffic by filtering access based on defined policies.

## Network Topology Overview
- **Finance Department (Orange Cluster):**  
  Hosts financial servers and workstations requiring secure connectivity.
- **IT Department (Red Cluster):**  
  Contains IT infrastructure with high-bandwidth requirements.
- **Admin Department (Green Cluster):**  
  Supports administrative operations with a focus on secure data handling.
- **Router-1:**  
  Connects the Finance and Admin networks, handling internal routing, DHCP services, and dynamic NAT.
- **Router-4:**  
  Connects to Router-1 externally and provides a gateway for NAT translations.

## Implementation Details
- **Routing:**  
  EIGRP is used for dynamic routing, ensuring efficient path selection among the internal networks.
- **NAT Configuration:**  
  Dynamic NAT is configured on Router-1 using a defined pool of public IP addresses to translate internal addresses when accessing external networks.
- **DHCP:**  
  Two DHCP pools are set up on Router-1—one for the Finance network and one for the Admin network—to automate IP address assignment.
- **ACLs:**  
  ACLs are implemented to secure traffic and enforce network policies.

## Prerequisites
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Basic knowledge of Cisco IOS commands and network configuration concepts

## Setup and Usage
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/enterprise-network-design.git
   cd enterprise-network-design

## Testing and Results
- Connectivity:
Devices across the Finance, IT, and Admin networks communicate successfully.
- DHCP:
Devices in the Finance and Admin networks receive IP addresses automatically.
- NAT:
Dynamic NAT translations are verified using show ip nat translations.
- Routing:
EIGRP neighbors and routes are confirmed using show ip eigrp neighbors and show ip route.

## Future Enhancements
- VPN Integration:
Add VPN support for secure remote access.
- IPv6 Deployment:
Upgrade the addressing scheme to include IPv6.
- Enhanced Security:
Implement additional security measures such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
- Topology Expansion:
Extend the design to include more departments or redundant paths.
